Masjid Mecca Website
It is a task which was given by my mentor.
As a zero coder at the begining ,it was challenged to achieve this result.
When I saw this design, it quite hard to predict the design of website because it's Navbar has more section than regular.

I have done this design using basics of Html and Css with the position(As of knowledge during that period, it is not even the proper positioning to the core)
I have found this thing in my folder, to reminded me of those days where I have starting learning.
So, I shared this because of my memory still exists.

It is only visible for greater than 1024px screen ratio, not even responsive in mobile or tablet view.
